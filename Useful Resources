FASTLED Notes:

>> When adding WS2812 LED stip on at least 8 pins on the Arduino Mega the LED colors changes. 
  - Steps to recreate: 
    1. In the Arduino IDE setup  add 8 leds
      Example:FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection( TypicalLEDStrip );
    2. In loop fill one LED Strip with Red and show it
  - Expected Results: Red Color LEDs on the entire WS2812 Strip
  - Actual Results: Lime Color LEds on the entire WS2812 Stip
  - Solution: Use FastLED FastLED3.1 branch instead. URL to Issue below:
